# Lossless_Image_Compression_Using_Tetrolet_Transformation

This review paper deals with the image compression technique by preserving image quality. The demand for images of multimedia is drastically increasing over the past decade, resulting in insufficient storage space and bandwidth. Due to this, the strategy of compressing the images is becoming more and more significant. This may result in decreasing the usage of expansive hard disks and transmission bandwidths. Images compressed with a high compression rate affects the quality of the image. Tetrolet transform is Harr type of wavelet transform that is supported by localized orthonormal tetrominoes which in turn are shapes made by connecting four equal-sized squares. A summary of various researches on Haar Wavelet transform and Tetrolet Transform for image compression are expressed in this paper.
